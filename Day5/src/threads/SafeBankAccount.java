/*
Code Explanation:
The synchronized keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the
withdraw() operation at a time, preventing RACE CONDITION and ensuring
correct balance deduction

ℹ️ Points to remember:
⭐ Synchronization avoids RACE CONDITION
⭐ Looks critical section in an application
⭐ slower but safe
